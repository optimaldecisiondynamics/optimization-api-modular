This repo supports my blog post tutorial ["Create and Deploy your own Optimization API: Part 2, Timless Models for Evolving Objectives"](https://medium.com/@louis-boguchwal/create-and-deploy-your-own-optimization-api-part-2-22b731fcbad0).

This is a complete code template to create and deploy your own optimization API, such that the optimization models have modular components.  This way, multiple objectives and related models can be supported in one codebase that follows a "separation of concern" design pattern.
